# Dimensionality Reduction

## Overview

This folder contains hands-on examples and explanations of various dimensionality reduction techniques in data science. Dimensionality reduction is crucial for simplifying datasets while retaining important information, improving model performance, and visualizing high-dimensional data.

## Contents

1. Statistical Terms for Dimensionality Reduction
2. Column Normalization
3. Column Standardization
4. Covariance of Data Matrix
5. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
6. PCA in Feature Extraction
7. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
